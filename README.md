# CNN-Breast-Tissue-Classification
This repository contains implementation of  a deep learning model for classifying breast tissue images into their respective categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of the system is to support early detection workflows by automatically analyzing medical imaging data and identifying patterns that may indicate abnormalities.
